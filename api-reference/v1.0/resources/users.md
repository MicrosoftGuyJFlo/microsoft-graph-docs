# Working with users in Microsoft Graph

You can use Microsoft Graph to build compelling app experiences based on users, their relationships with other users and groups, and their mail, calendar, and files.

You can access [users](user.md) through Microsoft Graph in two ways:

- By their ID, `/users/{id | userPrincipalName}`
- By using the `/me` alias for the signed-in user, which is the same as `/users/{signed-in user's id}`

## Authorization

One of the following [permissions](/graph/permissions-reference) is required to access user operations. The first three permissions can be granted to an app by a user. The rest can only be granted to an app by the administrator.

- User.ReadBasic.All
- User.Read
- User.ReadWrite
- User.Read.All
- User.ReadWrite.All
- Directory.Read.All
- Directory.ReadWrite.All
- Directory.AccessAsUser.All

## Common properties

The following represent the default set of properties that are returned when getting a user or listing users. These are a subset of all available properties. To get more user properties, use the `$select` query parameter. Learn [how to use the $select query parameter](/graph/query-parameters#select-parameter) and see [properties that support the $select query parameter](../resources/user.md#properties).

|Property |Description |
|:----------|:-------------|
|id | The unique identifier for the user.|
|businessPhones | The user's phone numbers.|
|displayName | The name displayed in the address book for the user.|
|givenName| The first name of the user. |
|jobTitle | The user's job title.|
|mail| The user's email address. |
|mobilePhone | The user's cellphone number.|
|officeLocation | The user's physical office location.|
|preferredLanguage | The user's language of preference.|
